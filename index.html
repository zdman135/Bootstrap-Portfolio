                                <img src="assets/images/profile.png" align="left"> Leon Thomas is the Regional Manager for American Family Insurance’s Northwestern Region. He oversees all claims and underwriting leadership for the region and serves as its liaison to the corporate office in Odenville. Originally from Odenville himself, Leon grew up just a few miles from the company’s headquarters. However, his was one of the few families in town that had no family members employed there.
                                Things changed, however, after Leon attended college. After graduating with a business degree, getting married, and having a baby all within a year’s time, he started at American Family as a Claims Adjuster. He was soon promoted to Claims Manager. He later moved to the Southern Region as a Consultant before being selected for his current role, in 2007 as Regional Manager.

                                Despite his unquestioned success, Leon remains humble about his accomplishments. He maintains that it’s important to keep the right perspective, something he’s strived to instill in his two daughters. He often reminds them, as well as his colleagues, of a story from one of his favorite books, The Noticer. The author says that life is a lot like a game of Monopoly: you may own Boardwalk and Park Place with two hotels but, when the game is over, all those pieces are going back in the box.
                                Without a doubt, it was his hard work and desire to excel that got Leon off to a great start at American Family. It was his vision and courage that moved him up the ladder. Today, it is his warmth and passion that make him such a valuable resource to the company and to all those around him.
